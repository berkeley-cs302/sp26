## Second half of First Exam Draft (or second quiz!)

For this assignment you will be drafting the second half of your first exam. If your course does quizzes instead, draft the second quiz instead.

Please create a google doc or pdf draft of your whole exam / second quiz and share with the instructors; you can also just use the same document where you made your first half of the exam.

## Exam Review Plan

Create a review plan for how someone should review your exam. As an example, here's the [<u>61A exam question review template</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDJSvURF5UwNaFjqR2ygpmwK7Wt7G0M6Y3c2bWJU8-o/edit#). The questions you ask reviewers should depend on your exam topic, format, and common issues that have been found with past exam questions.

## Exam Logistics

Write up your exam logistics. Here are some things to consider:

- Remote vs. in-person vs hybrid exam?
- Alternate times?
- Missed exam for an emergency? For a non emergency?
- Proctoring plan?
- Exam software?
- How do you plan to do clarifications during the exam for any mistakes that weren’t caught during the review process?
- Policy for questions asked by students during exam?
- …
