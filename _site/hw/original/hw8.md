**Responses:** [**<u>Document</u>**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19EkEPsB4Xnv_5y4UcVJBTB2zMq6ruZbwjPEc-hmzHug/edit#)

Your class will be uniquely filled with students who are all different. We want our courses to be accessible to all students taking them. In this homework you will dig more into accessibility and inclusivity and audit your course/past iterations of your course to find areas to improve.

## Audit \#1 Accessibility/Keyboard test of Website

This audit will check your website for accessibility issues, like those faced by students using a screen reader or just a keyboard with no mouse.

Step 1: Send HTML of homepage through validator [<u>https://validator.w3.org/</u>](https://validator.w3.org/)

Step 2: [<u>Automated audit with the Chrome lighthouse tab</u>](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

Step 3: [<u>Keyboard testing Guide</u>](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips-and-how-tos/how-do-keyboard-testing)

On the [<u>responses document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19EkEPsB4Xnv_5y4UcVJBTB2zMq6ruZbwjPEc-hmzHug/edit#), write up results for each step. Also link the webpage you audited. Be sure to mention any:

- Validation issues?

- Top Chrome lighthouse audit issues?

- Keyboard issues?

There should be 1 writeup per step per course.

See if you can fix any of these issues this semester. Definitely aim to get the top issues fixed by the time your course starts this summer.

## Audit \#2 Content of One Piece of Content Per Teammate

This audit will check your content for inclusivity.

First, to familiarize yourself with inclusivity on content, read (no need to comment):

- [<u>CS Content Inclusivity Guide</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LbMwoG19dLyn2PacB2ZRsXg1-HgS0txOL02GjKNSHHw/edit#heading=h.snwazixs4a7s) (by Pamela Fox)

- [<u>Using Inclusive Language</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lo2V-FwH7Cf8sOLYGvyZH4ioxQ8PnNZX/view) (Terms to avoid)

- [<u>Suggested Best Practices</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvmF4HXH3-Zi0W1p4vYwHG4TWfV2EWN76HN3faZTYpY/edit) (by Zephyr Barkan)

- Bonus: [<u>https://alexjs.com/</u>](https://alexjs.com/)

Then, for each course instructor, pick a different piece of content on the scale of a homework assignment, lab assignment, lecture, textbook chapter, exam, etc, where you can find at least one thing to change to make it more inclusive and accessible. Write up on the [<u>responses document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhosrrbEy06AAx9SRvoX3_CLYBmqQVv645w0qqFjYtM/edit#heading=h.7s4y7gy2ddu6) what you would change and why you are changing it.

## Audit \#3 Inclusivity of Syllabus

Now that each of you have learned about accessibility and inclusivity, work as a team to carefully go through your syllabus and audit the wording. Imagine how different students would read and what their reactions would be (low confidence students, high confidence students, those with lots of programming experience, those with little experience, etc).

Find a few things to improve about your syllabus and write it up as a team in the responses document.
